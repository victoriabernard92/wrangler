## üéôÔ∏è Commands

`wrangler` is a CLI tool designed for folks who are interested in using Cloudflare workers.

  - ### üëØ `generate` 
    Scaffold a project, including boilerplate for a Rust library and a Cloudflare Worker.
    You can pass a name and template to this command optionally. 

    ```
    wrangler generate <name> <template> --type=["webpack", "javascript", "rust"]
    ```

    All of the arguments and flads to this command are optional:
        - `name`: defaults to `worker`
        - `template`: defaults to the [`https://github.com/cloudflare/worker-template`](https://github.com/cloudflare/worker-template)
        - `type`: defaults to "webpack"

  - ### ü¶Ä‚öôÔ∏è `build`
    Build your project. This command looks at your `wrangler.toml` file and runs the build steps associated
    with the `"type"` declared there.

  - ### üî¨ `preview`
    Preview your project using the cloudflareworkers.com API.

    You can optionally pass `get` or `post` and a `body` to this command. This will send a request to your
    worker on the preview service and return the response in your terminal. For example:

    ```
    wrangler preview post hello=hello
    wrangler preview get // this is the default
    ```

  - ### ‚òÅÔ∏è üÜô `publish`

    Publish your Worker to Cloudflare. This uses several keys in your `wrangler.toml` depending on whether
    you are publishing to a workers.dev subdomain or your own domain, registered with Cloudflare.

    ```
    wrangler publish
    ```

    This command will publish your worker to your workers.dev subdomain. If you have set `private: true` in
    your `wrangler.toml` it will not make it publicly available. If you have set `private: false` or not
    set the `private` key, `publish` will make your worker available at `<project-name>.<subdomain>.workers.dev`.

    To use this, you'll need to have the following keys in your `wrangler.toml`:

    - `name`
    - `type`
    - `account_id`

    You'll also need to have a workers.dev subdomain registered. You can register a subdomain by using:

    ```
    wrangler subdomain <name>
    ```

    A `--release` can be optionally passed to publish your worker to a domain you have registered with
    Cloudflare. To use `--release` your `wrangler.toml` must include:

    - `name`
    - `type`
    - `account_id`
    - `zone_id`
    - `route`

  - ### üîß `config`
    Configure your global Cloudflare user. You will need to pass your email and API key:

    ```
    wrangler config <email> <api_key>
    ```

## üî© Configuration

There are two types of configuration that `wrangler` uses: global user and per project.

- ### Global User

    In Cloudflare's system, you have a User that can have multiple Accounts and Zones. As a result, your User
    is configured globally on your machine. Your Account(s) and Zone(s) will be configured per project, but
    will use your User credentials to authenticate all API calls. This config file is created in a `.wrangler`
    directory in your computer's home directory.

    To set up `wrangler` to work with your Cloudflare user, use the following commands:

    - üîß `config`: an interactive command that asks you to pass your `email` and `api` key. Alternatively, 
       you can use the flags `--email` and `--api-key` to the command to skip the interactive part.
    - üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è `whoami`: run this command to confirm that your configuration is appropriately set up.
       When successful, this command will print out your user information, including the type of plan you
       are currently on.


- ### Per Project

    Your project will need to have several things configured before you can publish your worker. These values
    are stored in a `wrangler.toml` file that `wrangler generate` will make for you. You will need to manually
    edit this file to add these values before you can publish.

    - `name`: This is the name of your project. It will be the name of your script.
    - `private`: This is a boolean. If set to `true`, when using `wrangler publish`, it will push your script but
        not make it publically available. This does not affect publishing in `--release` mode to a registered
        domain. Those pushes are *always* public. If this is not in your `wrangler.toml` it is assumed your
        project is public.
    - `type`: This key tells `wrangler build` how to build your project. There are currently 3 options, but we
        expect there to be more as the community grows.
        - `javascript`: This project contains a single JavaScript file, defined in `package.json`'s `main` key.
        - `rust`: This project contains a Rust crate that uses `wasm-bindgen`. It will be built with `wasm-pack`.
        - `webpack`: This project contains any number of JavaScript files or Rust/C/C++ files that compile to
            WebAssembly. Rust files will be built with `wasm-pack`. `C/C++` files will be build with `emscripten`.
            This project type uses webpack and webpack plugins in the background to build your worker.
    - `zone_id`: This is the ID of the "zone" or domain you want to run your script on. This is optional if you
        are using a workers.dev subdomain and is only reuqired for `publish --release`.
    - `account_id`: This is the ID of the account associated with your zone. You might have more than one account,
        so make sure to use the ID of the account associated with the `zone_id` you provide, if you provide one.
    - `route`: This is the route you'd like to use your worker on. You need to include the hostname. Examples:
        - `*example.com/*`
        - `http://example.com/hello`
        - `https://example.com/*/world`
        This key is optional if you are using a workers.dev subdomain and is only required for `publish --release`.

## ‚öì Installation

1. Install `cargo`:

    Wrangler is installed through [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo#compiling-from-source), a Rust package manager. Rustup, a tool for installing Rust, will also install Cargo. On Linux and macOS systems, `rustup` can be installed as follows:

    ```
    curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
    ```

    Additional installation methods are available [here](https://forge.rust-lang.org/other-installation-methods.html).

1. Install `wrangler`:

    ```
    cargo install wrangler
    ```

1. Troubleshooting OpenSSL errors

    If you are on a Mac, you might encounter an OpenSSL error when attempting to generate a project. You can resolve that issue by installing OpenSSL v1.1 through Homebrew (need to install Homebrew? Instructions available [here](https://brew.sh/)).

    ```
    $ brew install openssl@1.1
    ```

## ‚ö° Quick Start

1. Generate a new project:

    ```
    wrangler generate
    ```

1. Move into the new project directory:

    ```
    cd worker
    ```

1. Build your project:

    ```
    wrangler build
    ```

1. Preview your project:

    ```
    wrangler preview
    ```

1. (optional) Configure with your Cloudflare account:

    ```
    wrangler config <email> <api_key>
    ```

    Configuring your account is required to use the `publish` step, which will push your Worker live to the
    Cloudflare edge. If you don't configure, you can still use `wrangler` to generate, build, and preview
    a Worker.

    Optionally, create a workers.dev subdomain:

    ```
    wrangler subdomain <name>
    ```

1. Check your configuration:

    ```
    wrangler whoami
    ```

1. Publish your project:

    To publish to a workers.dev subdomain:
    ```
    wrangler publish
    ```

    To publish to a domain you have registered with Cloudflare, add a `route` and a `zone_id` to your
    `wrangler.toml`. Then run:

    ```
    wrangler publish --release
    ```
